// Design Rules: I like the idea of design rules and standards, but I didn't actually follow any constructing this site :(

// Below is what a section break looks like:

//**************************************************
/////// Loosely Followed Design Rules Below //////////
//**************************************************


// #1. All elements receive their own media queries
// #2. All box spacings below viewport width 1200 will use pre-set variables based on viewport width.
// #3. Each section of the webpage will have its own partial, and each web page would have its own folder of partials – should this web-site have more than one web-page, which, I know, it doesn't haha (yes, I believe colloquial comments are professional)
